  /* 
    TASK 4
    In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
    1. The first principle is window binding and it isn't best practice. Essentially window binding is the global default, and will return whats already in the browsers global window. strict mode, cancels this out and you'll be left with undefined.
    2. Implicit Binding is the next principle and is also the most commonly used. It is used within methods and applies when a function is called. The implicite binding refers to it being applied to whatever object is left of the dot.
    3. New binding is the next binding, and applies to constructor functions. The this is referring to the new object that is created when the constructor function is invoked and returned.
    4. Explicit binding is the last principle and is also used in constructor functions.It uses .call and .apply to bind.
